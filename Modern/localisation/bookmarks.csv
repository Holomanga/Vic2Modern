POSTWAR_NAME;Postwar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
POSTWAR_DESC;The Second World War, the most destructive war that the world has ever known, has come to a close. In its final days, the atomic bomb, a weapon capable of levelling cities, was deployed. Two great powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, seem poised to spread their influence over the globe, each knowing the other could use such a weapon again. Pick a side, or forge your own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
NWO_NAME;New World Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
NWO_DESC;The wall has fell! The clash between communism and capitalism seems to have came down decisively in favour of capitalism, and new trends towards globalisation, neoliberalism, and the communication enabled by the rapidly growing internet make it seem like this victory may stay forever. Maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
MILLENIUM_NAME;Turn of the Millenium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
MILLENIUM_DESC;After a gruelling 20th century, the world has entered the 21st. The economy and the internet are both growing rapidly, and it certainly seems like almost anything with .com in its name will be a worthy investment. Instant communication from anyone to anyone is becoming available for everyone. Make use of this digital revolution and take your nation to new heights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
